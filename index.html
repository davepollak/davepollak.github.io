									<p>With my brother, I want to study whether the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) should be part of the informed consent discussion. We are also interseted in the idea that one might be able to replace the use of diuretics with exercise to reduce fluid volume. At school I've proposed to study the potential benefits of spreading homework due dates through the week instead of having it done at the end of the week. The program director of our education department is interested any my dean is supportivebut we have an ongoing issue with the use of AI in the classroom which she has suggested I study first. I think it could make a real disfference for students if they had reason to study during the week and not only on weekends in terms of retention and creativity.

										Requiring the use of ChatGPT in my classes has forced me to change the way I teach. I was already using a flipped classroom model so I could see fingers on keyboards. Now I have to be even more interactive while they work to teach how to use AI responsibly and effectively. I received a request from an administrator asking me to ask students not to use ChatGPT to write emails to them. I've used that is my lead in to explaining why they need to 'own' their writing. "You don't want to be remembered for being annoying, right?" So, we use it for first drafts. Proofreading and revisions are necessary as is improving prompt engineering to a produce you would want to 'own'. It's an iterative process.  </p>

									<p>This is the class I cut my teeth on. It was really a fun thing to teach but I would completely redo the way we teach it with all hands on activities with Packet Tracer and Wireshark. I just learned that one of our instructors, Bob P, does incorporate Packet Tracer exercises in his classes which I remember discussing with him a couple of years ago. It is an area of interest that I keep learning new stuff about. Recently, i learned more about how the TLS handshake works and realized why it is a Layer 4 process - because encryption and decryption occur in user space which requires a port number to get there and ports are layer 4 elements. So much to learn. I watch every Hussein Nasser video that comes out. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Security</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/computersecurity.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I've just been asked to teach a computer risk management class for undergrads. I haven't taught security courses in a while but it's another area that I keep reading about and watching videos. I've had an initial look at the syllabus and would really like to modify it to include more hands on activities. I'd also flip the classroom so I could see the work. I think you can tell who well a student gets the material by the confidence their hands reveal when they are using the keyboard. Even one finger typists that know what they are doing reveal it in their hands. <br>  Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool developed by Cisco Systems primarily for educational purposes. While it's not a dedicated computer security tool, it can be used effectively in a computer security course to teach and demonstrate various networking and security concepts. Wireshark is a free protocol analyzer useful in networking and security courses. Here's how we could incorporate Packet Tracer into our computer security course:


<h3>Using Packet Tracer:</h3>

<ol>

<li><p> Network Design and Security Implementation: Packet Tracer allows you to create and simulate network topologies. You can use it to design complex networks and then guide students in implementing various security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), access control lists (ACLs), and VPNs.</p></li>

<li><p>Firewall Configuration: Create scenarios in which students must configure firewalls and set up rules to allow or deny specific types of traffic. Emphasize the importance of creating security rules and policies to protect the network.</p></li>

<li><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Simulate intrusion detection and prevention systems within Packet Tracer. Teach students how to configure and manage these systems and how to analyze security alerts.</p></li>

<li><p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Packet Tracer can be used to demonstrate VPN technologies. Students can set up and configure VPN connections, learning about encryption, authentication, and secure communication.</p></li>

<li><p>Packet Capture and Analysis: While Packet Tracer isn't as robust as Wireshark for packet analysis, it does offer some basic packet capture features. Use this for simple packet captures and show students how to inspect network traffic.</p></li>

<li><p> Network Hardening: Show students how to harden network devices and operating systems within the Packet Tracer environment. They can disable unnecessary services, configure strong authentication, and apply security patches.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Using Wireshark:</h3>
<ol>

<li><p>Packet Analysis: Wireshark is a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing network packets. Teach students how to capture network traffic, examine packet headers and payloads, and detect anomalies or security issues in the network traffic.</p></li>

<li><p>Security Monitoring: Use Wireshark to demonstrate real-world security monitoring scenarios. Show students how to set up capture filters to focus on specific traffic of interest and analyze that traffic for security events.</p></li>

<li><p> Malware Analysis: Wireshark can be used to analyze network traffic for signs of malware infections. Create scenarios where students analyze network traffic to identify malicious behavior and understand how malware operates.</p></li>

<li><p> Incident Response: In the event of a simulated security incident, use Wireshark to help students gather evidence from network traffic. Show them how to trace the source of an attack and respond effectively.</p></li>

<li><p>Security Protocols: Analyze network packets to teach students about various security protocols, including SSL/TLS, SSH, and IPsec. Show them how these protocols secure communication.</p></li>

<li><p>Vulnerability Assessment: Capture and analyze traffic during vulnerability scanning or penetration testing exercises. Teach students how to identify vulnerabilities and assess the impact on security.</p></li>

</ol>

									<p>We stopped using Tableau in favor of R but lots of students are asking for it again. Since we use R in so many classes, I may push for that to happen. I have less influence than I used to so maybe it won't happen. I think it makes sense to give students an exposure to a higher level tool like Tableau. Since it's free for them to use for a year, there really is no downside.  </p>

Teaching students to read the code line by line has gotten them up to speed pretty quickly. And using ChatGPT with the Noteable plugin has been great. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Learning is Architectural</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My friend, Gavin, turned me on to a book, “The Neuroscience of Learning and Development”, which has helped me crystalize a concern. The book, written by a student affairs professional, focuses on creating leaning environments. It wants educators to lower the silos between courses, use neuroscience to reduce anxiety, create learning communities, etc. I get that stuff, I think but it's not where my interest lies. </p>

<p>I want my students to remember what I've taught them or what they are learning on their own. Though I may be oversimplifying it, I think it is analogous to a weight training problem. My students seem to be satisfied with one rep which, as anyone who has tried to get stronger in the gym knows, won't work. I think maybe they are overconfident in their intellect but single trial learning rarely works because, well.. biology. If they understand an idea in the moment (single rep), they are satisfied.

									</p><p>I remember reading A Brief History of Time when I was in college. My experience convinced me in the moment that Steven Hawking had nothing intellectually on me. I understood exactly what he was talking about. That is, until I turned the page and had to apply whatever it was I had learned on the previous page. But, I couldn't. So, I went and played pool. I got to be really good at pool but cosmology has remained out of my reach. I was satisfied, too.</p>

<p>To encode a new idea in the brain requires making something grow. Nothing grows in nature instantly, at least not that I know of. And, I don't imagine neurons connect instantly either. Learning is a process not a mechanical connection that is opened or closed. But, that must be how they think of it. No matter how often it happens, they are surprised by the forgetting. </P> 

<p>I know what it takes to get stronger in the weight room because people have coached me and because I've experienced it. I know repetition is important and I know there has to be the right amount of weight. Too much results in injury. Too little and you don't get stronger. Why do I ever think I could read something, understand it, and then own it in a single try? </p>

<p>Students seem to think that learning should not require too much work. I remember that feeling. I didn't want to do the work but I realized that I wouldn't learn anything either. At the time, I was willing to make that trade. Somehow, my students have come to the belief that the tradeoff is obsolete. Learning should be easy and, if it is not, they believe they don't have the capacity to learn whatever it is. They don't think that they just have to work harder.</p> 

<p>They seem satisfied with the level of learning that is happening however muddy, imprecise, and ephemeral it may be. There is complete comfort with knowing just a little. The other day in machine learning class, I put a formula on the board for determining information gain as the result of the partition of a data set. Not a single one of my students asked me to help them understand it. When I asked them if they got it, I received a round of affirmative head nods. But, when I asked them to read it out loud to me, none could do it. I went around the room and offered goodies to whoever could do it.  They didn’t know what the sigma symbol stood for or what probability the p stood for. When we read through it symbol by symbol it I could see the light of understanding going on. Why is there no discomfort with not knowing? </p>

									<p>In my Python class, it’s the same. They will comment a block of code for building a pie chart but they won’t be able to tell me what any of the particular functions are actually doing. However, when we read the code line by line and I ask them to look up what each function and parameter is doing, it’s like a miracle. “Aha”, their faces seem to be saying to me. “Now I get it.” Why do they need me to make them make sense of what they see? </p>

<p>Same thing happens in my health informatics class. They see the phrase ‘data is a strategic asset’ over and over again. Yet, when I ask them why hospitals don’t want to share their data, it is the rare one who will remember and say  ‘because it is strategic’. But, if I ask them what makes it strategic, not one will be able to answer. Not one of the probably 150 students I’ve had in this class has been able to answser that question. When I asked them what the implication would be for data governance, there were just blank stares. An abstraction on an abstraction is far to much to expect. </p>

									<p>You might be thinking my students must be freshmen but they are not. They are grad students who have mostly had 3 - 5 years of work experience.  I beg and plead with them to turn on their curiosity buttons. “Don’t be satisfied with a cursory understanding of something.” “Own it,” I say. Then I remember that they lack the framework for making meaning of these symbols, code, and terms. We have to start somewhere. So, we read the symbols, interpret the code and discuss the terms until I think we’ve gotten somewhere. Then a week goes by and it’s as if the last week never happened. 

</p><p>ut, we are attempting to build habits that I hope will stick. I require that they have ChatGPT or Bard or Bing open during class and I ask questions constantly. At the beginning of the term, when I ask what the symbol or snippet of code or word means, they will just look to me for an answer. “Look it up”, I say. By the fifth week, I can mime it and they laugh and say the words for me. I don’t think it is translating out of the classroom, quite yet, but I’m hopeful. I think what I’m attempting is the building of a constructivist culture. I’m not too familiar with the term so I have some work to do, too. </p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/farmallcub.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a beautiful tractor that I bought from a guy when he got frustrated with it. He rebuilt the whole thing but could not get it to run. It was cheap enough that I figured I could get my money back even if it wouldn't run but I figured it out. It had two problems, the starter was bad and he had the ground backwards. </p>
							<p>These are postive ground vehicles. I replaced the starter and switched the battery connections around and it ran but it was still problematic. I decided that the really nice paint job was interfering with the ground connections. I ran a second line from the battery to the starter which worked perfectly...until it caught fire. </p>
									<p>The connection was too close to the body of the tractor causing an arc that ignited the waxy paper it used for an insulator on the starting switch that is attached to the starter. There I was triumphantly driving it down the road looking for my neighbor to impress when I heard the sound and, turning my head, saw the flames. Luckly, I was able to extinguish it before doing anything other than burning the starter switch up. </p>
									<p> I took the starter off to paint it to match the rest of the body. It is still waiting for me to paint it. I can change that starter in just about a minute...soon as I paint it.   </p>

The ring gear is worn so it won't start with the starter. I have to use the crank but I'm getting pretty good at that. Haven't broken my wrist yet though there was a pretty good kick back when I was first learning to start it. Changed the oil this year. Gonna lube it up next year and, hopefully, split it and get to that ring gear. </p>

									<p>I installed a RHEEM heat pump hot water heater. I could not get the Wifi to connect. I wasn't following the instructions to turn it off on my phone. When my son pointed that out to me it worked fine. Duh. Follow the instructions. <p>After two years it started throwing errors and would stop working. Resetting it would work for a while. I called RHEEM who went through the diagnostics with me, fixed it temporarily, and sent me the parts I needed to fix it. I had to replace 3 thyristers (sp) which involved turning off the power, taking the top off the machine, finding the three parts, removing and replacing them. The parts were easy to find because the wires to them are color coded. The space is tight for my hands and, as with everything I do now, figuring out how much light and where to put my head so my glasses don't slip off is challenge. They are glued to supply pipes with sticky take. The best way to remove and replace is to pull them straight out of the tape leaving a void for the replacement. Unfortunately, I figured that out after I removed the sticky tape entirely on the first one. That's my usual learning style. Screw it up once then do it better.
