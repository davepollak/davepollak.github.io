									<p>I haven't taught this course in a while either. I've been pushing for the movement to the flipped classroom with lots more hands on activities. I'd like to design a new course but it's way on the back burner. If they'd let me, I'd supervise somebody else to do it with my treaching methods. No more sage on the stage. I require that the do the homework before class, have a student doing the demo in the front of the room while I teach from the back, watching what they are doing, asking questions, keeping things moving, etc. It is way better than having them sitting there blank faced while I talk about stuff that is completely over their heads. I have no idea why they just accept what they hear without understanding and without asking any questions. They don't seem to remember anything from previous courses so I have to reteach what a port is to explain how NMAP works. </p>

									<p>DWe stopped using Tableau in favor of R but lots of students are asking for it again. Since we use R in so many classes, I may push for that to happen. I have less influence than I used to so maybe it won't happen. I think it makes sense to give students an exposure to a higher level tool like Tableau. Since it's free for them to use for a year, there really is no downside.  </p>

									<p>Teaching this course for a couple of years has taught me a lot about the model building process. Learning now how to optimize the models. Teaching students to read the code line by line has gotten them up to speed pretty quickly. And using ChatGPT with the Noteable plugin has been great. /p>

										<h2><a href="#">Learning is Architectural</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My friend, Gavin, turned me on to a book, “The Neuroscience of Learning and Development”, which has helped me crystalize a concern. The book, written by a student affairs professional, focuses on creating leaning environments. It wants educators to lower the silos between courses, use neuroscience to reduce anxiety, create learning communities, etc. I get that stuff, I think but it's not where my interest lies. </p>

<p>I want my students to remember what I've taught them or what they are learning on their own. Though I may be oversimplifying it, I think it is analogous to a weight training problem. My students seem to be satisfied with one rep which, as anyone who has tried to get stronger in the gym knows, won't work. I think maybe they are overconfident in their intellect but single trial learning rarely works because, well.. biology. If they understand an idea in the moment (single rep), they are satisfied.

									</p><p>I remember reading A Brief History of Time when I was in college. My experience convinced me in the moment that Steven Hawking had nothing intellectually on me. I understood exactly what he was talking about. That is, until I turned the page and had to apply whatever it was I had learned on the previous page. But, I couldn't. So, I went and played pool. I got to be really good at pool but cosmology has remained out of my reach. I was satisfied, too.</P>

<p>To encode a new idea in the brain requires making something grow. Nothing grows in nature instantly, at least not that I know of. And, I don't imagine neurons connect instantly either. Learning is a process not a mechanical connection that is opened or closed. But, that must be how they think of it. No matter how often it happens, they are surprised by the forgetting. </P> 

<p>I know what it takes to get stronger in the weight room because people have coached me and because I've experienced it. I know repetition is important and I know there has to be the right amount of weight. Too much results in injury. Too little and you don't get stronger. Why do I ever think I could read something, understand it, and then own it in a single try? </P>

<p>Students seem to think that learning should not require too much work. I remember that feeling. I didn't want to do the work but I realized that I wouldn't learn anything either. At the time, I was willing to make that trade. Somehow, my students have come to the belief that the tradeoff is obsolete. Learning should be easy and, if it is not, they believe they don't have the capacity to learn whatever it is. They don't think that they just have to work harder. 

</p><p>They seem satisfied with the level of learning that is happening however muddy, imprecise, and ephemeral it may be. There is complete comfort with knowing just a little. The other day in machine learning class, I put a formula on the board for determining information gain as the result of the partition of a data set. Not a single one of my students asked me to help them understand it. When I asked them if they got it, I received a round of affirmative head nods. But, when I asked them to read it out loud to me, none could do it. I went around the room and offered goodies to whoever could do it.  They didn’t know what the sigma symbol stood for or what probability the p stood for. When we read through it symbol by symbol it I could see the light of understanding going on. Why is there no discomfort with not knowing? 

									</p><p>In my Python class, it’s the same. They will comment a block of code for building a pie chart but they won’t be able to tell me what any of the particular functions are actually doing. However, when we read the code line by line and I ask them to look up what each function and parameter is doing, it’s like a miracle. “Aha”, their faces seem to be saying to me. “Now I get it.” Why do they need me to make them make sense of what they see? 

</p><p>Same thing happens in my health informatics class. They see the phrase ‘data is a strategic asset’ over and over again. Yet, when I ask them why hospitals don’t want to share their data, it is the rare one who will remember and say  ‘because it is strategic’. But, if I ask them what makes it strategic, not one will be able to answer. Not one of the probably 150 students I’ve had in this class has been able to answser that question. When I asked them what the implication would be for data governance, there were just blank stares. An abstraction on an abstraction is far to much to expect. 

									</P><P>You might be thinking my students must be freshmen but they are not. They are grad students who have mostly had 3 - 5 years of work experience.  I beg and plead with them to turn on their curiosity buttons. “Don’t be satisfied with a cursory understanding of something.” “Own it,” I say. Then I remember that they lack the framework for making meaning of these symbols, code, and terms. We have to start somewhere. So, we read the symbols, interpret the code and discuss the terms until I think we’ve gotten somewhere. Then a week goes by and it’s as if the last week never happened. 

</P><P>ut, we are attempting to build habits that I hope will stick. I require that they have ChatGPT or Bard or Bing open during class and I ask questions constantly. At the beginning of the term, when I ask what the symbol or snippet of code or word means, they will just look to me for an answer. “Look it up”, I say. By the fifth week, I can mime it and they laugh and say the words for me. I don’t think it is translating out of the classroom, quite yet, but I’m hopeful. I think what I’m attempting is the building of a constructivist culture. I’m not too familiar with the term so I have some work to do, too. </p>

									<p>I love this tractor. It just looks like a workhorse. So far, I've just used it for mowing. Hoping I have enough good weather left to put the plow on it. The ring gear is worn so it won't start with the starter. I have to use the crank but I'm getting pretty good at that. Haven't broken my wrist yet though there was a pretty good kick back when I was first learning to start it. Changed the oil this year. Gonna lube it up next year and, hopefully, split it and get to that ring gear. </p>

									<p>I've planted a half dozen chestnut hybrids hoping they will take. So far so good. I've also got some pear, peach, and apple. It's a challenge keeping the bittersweet from strangling them. Gotta be on my guard. That stuff is aggressive. Last year I got some peaches and a pear. Nothing this year, though. Also, planted some blueberries which had some fruit last year but nothing this year. Not enough watering? I thought having been regularly deluged this summer would have been enough but maybe not?  </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Heat Pump Hot Water Heater</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/rheem.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I installed a RHEEM heat pump hot water heater. I could not get the Wifi to connect. I wasn't following the instructions to turn it off on my phone. When my son pointed that out to me it worked fine. Duh. Follow the instructions. <p>After two years it started throwing errors and would stop working. Resetting it would work for a while. I called RHEEM who went through the diagnostics with me, fixed it temporarily, and sent me the parts I needed to fix it. I had to replace 3 thyristers (sp) which involved turning off the power, taking the top off the machine, finding the three parts, removing and replacing them. The parts were easy to find because the wires to them are color coded. The space is tight for my hands and, as with everything I do now, figuring out how much light and where to put my head so my glasses don't slip off is challenge. They are glued to supply pipes with sticky take. The best way to remove and replace is to pull them straight out of the tape leaving a void for the replacement. Unfortunately, I figured that out after I removed the sticky tape entirely on the first one. That's my usual learning style. Fuck it up once then do it better. Check out my Farmall story for a really good fuckup.  </p></p>
